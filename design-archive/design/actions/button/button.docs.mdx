## Component usage

Use the `Button` component to trigger actions or navigate to different pages. It supports different appearances and can be disabled.

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>Click me</Button>
```
## Button Appearances
The `Button` component supports three different appearances: primary, secondary, and tertiary.
### Primary Button
Primary buttons are used for the main action on a page.
```jsx
<Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => alert('Primary button clicked!')}>
  Primary
</Button>
```
### Secondary Button
Secondary buttons are used for less important actions.
```jsx
<Button appearance="secondary" onClick={() => alert('Secondary button clicked!')}>
  Secondary
</Button>
```
### Tertiary Button
Tertiary buttons are used for actions that are even less important or for actions that are destructive.
```jsx
<Button appearance="tertiary" onClick={() => alert('Tertiary button clicked!')}>
  Tertiary
</Button>
```
## Button as a Link
The `Button` component can also be used as a link by providing the `href` property.
### Internal Link
```jsx
<MemoryRouter>
  <Button href="/internal" appearance="primary">
    Internal Link
  </Button>
</MemoryRouter>
```
### External Link
```jsx
<Button href="https://bit.dev" external appearance="secondary">
  External Link
</Button>
```
## Disabled Button
The `Button` component can be disabled by setting the `disabled` property to `true`.
```jsx
<Button disabled>Disabled Button</Button>
