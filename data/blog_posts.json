    "body_md": "# Welcome to HOTMESS Radio\n\nAfter months of planning, dreaming, and arguing about the perfect balance of chaos and care, HOTMESS Radio is finally here. Broadcasting 24/7, our station isn't just background noise—it's a lifeline, a party, a therapy session, and a revolution all rolled into one.\n\n## Why Radio? Why Now?\n\nIn a world that profits from our isolation, radio builds community. In a culture that demands we shrink ourselves, we're taking up space on the airwaves. HOTMESS Radio exists because queer voices deserve to be heard not just during Pride month, but every single day.\n\n## Our Shows, Your Soundtrack\n\n**Wake the Mess** (Weekday mornings) starts your day with unfiltered queer energy and music that makes productivity look like the scam it is.\n\n**Dial-a-Daddy** (Daily afternoons) offers advice with authority, care with kink, and solutions that actually work.\n\n**Hand N Hand** (Sunday evenings) provides weekly aftercare for your body and mind, sponsored by HNH MESS—the only lube with real aftercare.\n\n**Pre-Drinks** (Friday nights) gets you ready for whatever the weekend brings with beats that build anticipation.\n\n**Club Hours** (Saturday nights) delivers four hours of pure dancefloor euphoria.\n\n**Midnight Confessions** (Wednesday nights) creates space for your softest thoughts and deepest secrets.\n\n## More Than Music\n\nEach show includes live chat rooms, call-in opportunities, and community features that make listening interactive. Because radio should be a conversation, not a monologue.\n\n## Listen Now\n\nTune in at [hotmess.radio](https://hotmess.radio) or through our app. The player persists while you browse our site, because we know you've got other messy business to attend to.\n\nYour mess is welcome here. Always.",

True consent culture means creating spaces where people feel empowered to set boundaries and confident those boundaries will be honored.\n\n## The FRIES Model\n\nConsent should be:\n- **F**reely given (no coercion)\n- **R**eversible (can be withdrawn)\n- **I**nformed (understanding what you're agreeing to)\n- **E**nthusiastic (genuine excitement)\n- **S**pecific (clear about what you're consenting to)\n\n## Beyond the Bedroom\n\nConsent culture applies everywhere:\n\n### Physical Touch\n- Ask before hugging, even friends\n- Check in during longer embraces\n- Respect personal space at events\n- Create clear signals for \"yes\" and \"no\"\n\n### Digital Spaces\n- Ask before sharing someone's content\n- Respect communication boundaries\n- Don't screenshot private conversations\n- Honor someone's right to disengage\n\n### Event Planning\n- Include accessibility information\n- Offer content warnings\n- Create multiple ways to participate\n- Train staff on boundary enforcement\n\n## Building Community Agreements\n\nEvery space needs explicit agreements about:\n- How to ask for what you want\n- How to say no without explanation\n- What happens when boundaries are crossed\n- How to support someone setting boundaries\n\n## When Consent is Violated\n\nHaving clear processes for addressing violations is crucial:\n1. **Immediate safety** - Remove the person causing harm\n2. **Support the harmed** - Center their needs and wishes\n3. **Community response** - Address the behavior systematically\n4. **Accountability process** - If the harmer wants to return\n\n## Resources for Going Deeper\n\n- [Consent Culture Toolkit](https://example.com)\n- [Transformative Justice Resources](https://example.com)\n- [Community Accountability Practices](https://example.com)\n\n## Remember\n\nConsent culture isn't about perfection—it's about commitment to doing better. Start where you are, be open to feedback, and remember that building consent culture is ongoing work that makes all our spaces safer and more connected.\n\n*Need support implementing consent culture in your community?

Not every person you meet will become family, and that's okay. Focus on nurturing the connections that feel authentic and life-giving.\n\nYour chosen family might look different from anyone else's, and that's exactly how it should be. The goal isn't to recreate traditional family structures but to build something that truly serves your needs for love, support, and belonging.\n\n*Need support navigating chosen family relationships?
