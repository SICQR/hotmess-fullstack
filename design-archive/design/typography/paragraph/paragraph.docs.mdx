## Basic Usage

The most straightforward way to use the `Paragraph` component is to wrap your text content:

```jsx
<Paragraph>
  This is a standard paragraph. You can use this component to ensure consistent typography across your application.
</Paragraph>
```
## Rendering as a Different Element
You can change the underlying HTML element by using the `element` prop. This is useful for semantic purposes or when you need to integrate the paragraph into a specific layout:
```jsx
<Paragraph element="span">
  This paragraph is rendered as a `span` element, which is useful for inline text.
</Paragraph>
```
## Applying Custom Styles
You can apply custom styles to the `Paragraph` component using the `className` or `style` props:
```jsx
<Paragraph className="custom-paragraph" style={{ color: 'blue' }}>
  This paragraph has custom styles applied to it.
</Paragraph>
