## Use in existing workspaces

Add the development env to your generator configuration on `workspace.jsonc`.

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": [
      "philip-gizzie/philip-gizzie-env"
    ]
  }
}
```
You can see the generator templates in your workspace using `bit templates`.
## Use on an existing component
Use this dev environment on your existing components, by running the following command:
```
bit env set my-component philip-gizzie/philip-gizzie-env
```
## Create a React workspace
You can create a new React workspace made from this env using the following command:
```
bit new react my-workspace --aspect philip-gizzie/philip-gizzie-env
```
## Compose your own env
You can base on this env, and customize it to your needs. To create your env run this command:
```
bit create react-env my-new-env --scope philip-gizzie
```
Make sure your new environment class extends this env class and overrides the needed class methods.
