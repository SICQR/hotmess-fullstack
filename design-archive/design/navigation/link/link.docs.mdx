The `Link` component provides a unified way to create both internal and external links. It leverages React Router for internal navigation and standard `<a>` tags for external URLs.

## Internal Link

For navigating within your application, use the `Link` component with a `href` that corresponds to a route defined in your React Router setup.

```
<MemoryRouter>
  <Link href="/home">Go to Home</Link>
</MemoryRouter>
```
This creates a link that navigates the user to the `/home` route within your application, without a full page reload.
## External Link
To link to external websites, set the `external` prop to `true`. This will render a standard `<a>` tag with appropriate `target` and `rel` attributes.
```
<MemoryRouter>
  <Link href="https://bit.dev" external>
    Visit Bit.dev
  </Link>
</MemoryRouter>
```
This creates a link that opens the Bit.dev website in a new tab, enhancing the user experience and maintaining security.
## Link within Text
The `Link` component can be seamlessly integrated within paragraphs or other text elements.
```
<MemoryRouter>
  <p>
    This is a paragraph that contains an
    <Link href="/internal-documentation">internal link</Link>
    and also an
    <Link href="https://google.com" external>
      external link to Google
    </Link>.
    Notice how they blend with the text.
  </p>
</MemoryRouter>
```
This example demonstrates how the `Link` component can be used to create rich, navigable text content.
