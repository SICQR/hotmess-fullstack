The `CodeBlock` component allows you to display code snippets with syntax highlighting for various programming languages. It also provides a button to copy the code to the clipboard.

## Basic Usage

Displaying a simple code snippet:

```jsx
<CodeBlock language="javascript">
  console.log("Hello, world!");
</CodeBlock>
```
## Code Block with Title
You can add a title to the code block for better context:
```jsx
<CodeBlock language="python" title="main.py">
  def hello_world():
      print("Hello, world!")
  hello_world()
</CodeBlock>
```
## Copy to Clipboard
The component includes a copy button that allows users to easily copy the code to their clipboard. A "Copied!" message is displayed briefly after copying.
```jsx
<CodeBlock language="json" title="config.json">
{`
  "name": "example-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An example application"
`}
</CodeBlock>
