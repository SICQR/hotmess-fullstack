The SectionLayout component is designed to structure content on a page with a consistent and visually appealing layout. It supports an optional title, caption, and subtitle, making it versatile for various use cases.

## Basic Usage

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the SectionLayout component with a title, subtitle, and some content.

```jsx
<SectionLayout
  title="Welcome to Our Platform"
  subtitle="Explore the possibilities and discover how we can help you achieve your goals."
>
  <div>
    This is the main content area. Add your text, images, or other components here.
  </div>
</SectionLayout>
```
## Full Featured Section
This example shows how to use all available props: `caption`, `title`, and `subtitle`, to create a more detailed section header.
```jsx
<SectionLayout
  caption="Getting Started"
  title="Create Your Account"
  subtitle="Sign up and start exploring our amazing features today."
>
  <div>
    Ready to take the next step? Click the button below to create your account.
  </div>
</SectionLayout>
```
## Section with Only Content
This example shows a SectionLayout with only content, useful for sections where a title or subtitle are not needed.
```jsx
<SectionLayout>
  <div>
    This section contains only the main content, without a title or subtitle.
  </div>
</SectionLayout>
